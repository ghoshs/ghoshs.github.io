<p>Count information is the relation between an entity and a set of entities that can be expressed as <strong>enumerations</strong> of individual instances, as X is an employee of Z, Y is an employee of Z or as a <strong>cardinality</strong> Z has N employees.
</p> 

<p>Identifying such information in text and knowledge bases (KBs) and linking the two variants can: </p>

<ul>
    <li>identify incomplete entity enumerations</li>
    <li>ground counts in representative entities</li>
    <li>identify KB inconsistencies</li>
    <li>enhance downstream tasks like search and question answering</li>
</ul>

Most research focus on numerical facts without joining the dots between numerical facts specifying cardinal information and their corresponding entity-to-entity grounding facts. Popular general-purpose KBs have limited ability to recognize such predicates.
